# chatgpt-demo

This repository demonstrates a simple setup for running Python scripts. The
`demo.py` script prints a short greeting. It can serve as a starting point for
more advanced experiments.

## Running the demo

```bash
python3 demo.py
```

## Playing the Snake game

A small terminal-based snake game is provided in `snake_game.py`. Use the arrow
keys to move the snake and eat the "*" food items. The game ends when the snake
collides with the border or itself.

```bash
python3 snake_game.py
```
